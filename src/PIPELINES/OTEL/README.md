# OpenTelemetry Icon Set

## Prior Art

* [@open-telemetry] The OpenTelemetry site (https://opentelemetry.io/) has some fantastic assets for icongraphy which can be found here: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/iconography
* [@devrimdemiroz] Devrim Demiroz for his work on grouping TML Signals (Traces, Metrics, Logs) for representation via Cartography. Sample article: https://medium.com/@devrim.demiroz/unlocking-tempo-apm-dashboard-without-tempo-fcbb0f433998

## Mental Model 

* #TODO : Describe how you came up with these icon sets. 
* #TODO : cover Octagons vs Squares vs Rectangles
